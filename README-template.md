## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned:

  - how to crop images and shift its position within a container, using object-fit: cover and object-position

  - to set a max-width so that the card won't stretch too much on bigger screens, and would shrink on smaller ones.

  - that along with flex gap, I can add margins/paddings to better match the design mockup.

  - how to hide a tooltip in a mobile layout, by positioning it absolute and giving it a z-index of -1, then reversing that via trigger. I also learned how to measure and adjust its height so that the card won't change dimensions when triggered.

  - to remember to set the overflow to visible when making a tooltip that overlaps the main nesting div.

  - how to set the little arrow of the tooltip ðŸ˜†. it's actually setting solid border but making three out of four edges transparent.

  - Making the tooltip overflow the card while maintaining the border-radius on the picture side was harder than I thought. I set the card's overflow to visible, and added border-radius and overflow attributes to the image's container. I adjusted that container's width until it matches the width of the image.

### Continued development

- I should improve:

  - my routine of doing the css styles. It's still too scattered for me.

  - my routine of matching dimensions. I could look at Chrome Developer to get the exact pixels instead of just randomly setting the sizes until it fits.

  - how modular my code is. It's good practice to do these from scratch, but when it's time to build a full webpage, I want to speed it up by copying and pasting templates I made.
